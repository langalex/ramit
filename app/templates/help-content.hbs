<h4>Welcome to Ramit!</h4>

<p>Ramit is a personal accounting app inspried by the book 'I will teach you to be rich' by Ramit Sethi.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>It is based on the idea that for each area of spending you preload an account with money and only spend as much of it as you have in that account.</p>

<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>Create one account for each area of spending, for example <em>going out</em>, <em>clothes</em> or <em>transport</em>.</p>
<p>Each month you put money that you actually have in each of the account by creating a transaction with the appropriate amount.</p>
<p>Each time you spend money add a transaction with a negative amount to the account. As soon as the account is empty you cannot spend any more money.</p>

<h4>Remote Storage</h4>
<p>All the data you enter is stored on your device. If you want you can back it up to a server (and synchronize it with other devices) by getting a <a href="http://remotestorage.io/get/">remoteStorage</a> account and connecting it using the widget at the bottom.</p>
